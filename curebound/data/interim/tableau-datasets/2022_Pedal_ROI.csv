Studies of ALL tumors have led to improved therapies, and increased long-term survival rates in children from ~58% in the 1970s to over 90% today. Yet 10-20% of ALL patients relapse following their initial treatment, and these patients have a  grim prognosis with survival rates between 21% and 53%. Therefore, there is a need for improved therapies stemming from a better understanding of the molecular events that promote ALL progression and relapse. We hypothesize that some genetic mutations that are important for ALL onset and relapse have remained  undiscovered because they are located in parts of the genome that are difficult to study. Specifically, most studies have focused on mutations that directly affect protein-coding genes, rather than ""non-coding regulatory"" mutations that affect which genes are expressed. We propose to develop new approaches to  identify non-coding mutations in ALL tumors. The basis for our approach is computational analysis of data from new methods (known as ATAC-seq and Hi-C) that provide information about the location and 3D organization of non-coding regulatory sequences in the genome. We will perform ATAC-seq and Hi-C experiments on 20 ALL tumor samples from patients at Rady Children's Hospital-San Diego and use the resulting data to identify non-coding regulatory mutations.

The ""hardness"" of breast tumors correlates with distant metastasis and poor outcome in breast cancer patients. Recent studies show that breast tumors show a 10-50-fold increase of mechanical force exerted on tumor cells compared to normal breast tissues and that mechanical force generated by increasing hardness of breast tumors promotes breast cancer metastasis. However, it is unknown how mechanical force impacts breast cancer metastasis and whether therapeutic targeting of this regulatory mechanism could halt breast cancer progression and metastasis. Our ongoing studies have identified two druggable candidate proteins that are likely to play essential roles in promoting breast tumor invasion and metastasis in response to high matrix rigidities in the tumor microenvironment. In this proposal, we aim to further characterize these two proteins in this novel metastasis regulatory pathway and determine whether therapeutic targeting these two proteins could inhibit breast cancer invasion of surrounding normal tissue and the formation of metastases.

This is a proposal to examine whether in humans, a long nightly fasting interval  can reduce the risk of cancer. Research in rodents indicates that this type of time-restricted feeding can protect against obesity, high insulin levels, fatty liver, and inflammation; all of which can increase cancer risk. Data from human studies are limited, but also suggest positive effects on these markers of cancer risk. The  hypothesis of this study is that a regular pattern of prolonged nightly fasting (13 or more hours per night) will improve factors that may increase the risk of common cancers. Specifically, we propose to test whether in comparison to a short fasting interval, a 13+ hour nightly fasting interval is associated with lower blood glucose  levels, lower inflammation, lower levels of obesity, and improved sleep. As exploratory aims, we will investigate the association of prolonged nightly fasting with metabolites in the blood, such as sugars and fats.

Unfortunately, thus far, applying such knowledge to pancreatic cancer hasn't helped. We believe that the lack  of progress is in part due to the fact that pancreatic cancers grow encased in a thick tissue protective layer called the ""activated stroma"". This stroma acts both as a barrier to drug entry and also provides fuel for cancer cell growth. We hypothesize that drugs that ""reprogram"" the stroma to make it more ""normal"" will increase the efficacy of cancer cell therapy. We propose to test one ""smart-drug"" that is in clinical trials to ""reprogram"" the stroma, and a second ""smart-drug"" to make pancreatic cancer cells and their metastases more sensitive to standard chemotherapy drugs. This innovative outside-in strategy will combat the barriers posed by pancreatic cancer, and could have significant community impact by reducing death and suffering caused by this deadly  cancer.

Growth factor receptors are proteins on the surfaces of cancer cells that generate signals leading to cancer cell growth and spread, and these receptors therefore  represent potential targets for new treatments for many pediatric solid tumors. Cabozantinib is an inhibitor of several key growth factor receptors and kills pediatric solid tumor cells, and the effectiveness of cabozantinib is  increased when combined with 13-cis-retinoic acid. However, the safety and efficacy of the combination of cabozantinib with 13-cis-retinoic acid in children with solid tumors are unknown. We believe that cabozantinib and 13-cis-retinoic acid will be safe and effective in children with relapsed and refractory solid tumors and that  children will have altered levels of specific proteins in their blood and tumor cells after cabozantinib treatment.  We will test the combination of cabozantinib and 13-cis-retinoic acid in a national multi-institutional phase I clinical trial for children with relapsed and refractory solid tumors, including brain tumors, and we will also evaluate the levels of proteins in patient blood and tumor samples to determine their association with responses to treatment.

It is therefore imperative to develop new treatments to  improve survival. As we learn more about the factors driving progression of metastatic prostate cancer, we have discovered that the Wnt signaling pathway is activated in these patients. The Wnt pathway possibly confers resistance to standard drug treatments, including hormone therapy and chemotherapy. Prior attempts to target this pathway have been unsuccessful. Cirmtuzumab, a ROR1-binding monoclonal antibody which inhibits the Wnt pathway, is a compelling new drug with the potential to treat CRPC by blocking Wnt activity.  Cirmtuzumab was developed at UCSD by Drs. Kipps, Jamieson, and Carson. Studies are underway in chronic lymphocytic leukemia and breast cancer. We hypothesize that the addition of cirmtuzumab to docetaxel, a chemotherapy drug, will be safe and effective for patients with metastatic CRPC. To test this hypothesis for  the first time, we propose a clinical trial of cirmtuzumab combined with docetaxel in men with prostate cancer. To better understand mechanisms of drug resistance, and which patients might benefit most from  cirmtuzumab, we will perform molecular analyses of cancer tissue and blood samples throughout the study.

Part of the difficulty in treating PDAC is its characteristic dense scarring (""fibrosis"").  This scarring is generated by pancreatic cancer associated fibroblasts (PCAFs).  This project seeks to build on our recent discovery that PCAFs have high expression of novel protein on their cell surface.  This protein, known as a GPCR, is activated by the acidic (low pH) environment that exists in pancreatic cancers.  When activated by this low pH, the PCAFs communicate with the PDAC cells to enhance their growth.  In this project, UCSD investigators will conduct studies to define additional responses produced by exposure of CAFs to low pH and with Sanford-Burnham-Prebys Cancer Center/Medical Discovery Institute (SBP), will assess ""libraries"" (collections) of chemical compounds, certain of which are predicted to antagonize the GPCR we identified and which, as a result, should block the production of scarring and stimulation of PDAC growth by the PCAFs.  These studies that combine efforts at UCSD with those at SBP thus focus on the ""tumor microenvironment"" in which PDAC cells and PCAFs interact and will test the idea that a drug that blocks a special type of GPCR present in PCAF cells can provide a novel way to assist in the treatment PDAC tumors and thus may be a new way to improve the outcome of this very deadly type of cancer.",75000.0,2017-05-01,2018-04-30,Complete,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0.0,,,,,,,,

These agents are generally well tolerated and can have deep and enduring responses once immune recognition of the tumor has occurred.  Unfortunately, over 80% of cancer patients do not benefit from current immunotherapies because the available drugs are ineffective at inducing immune rejection of the tumor.  Accordingly, we hypothesized that if a patient's immune system is stimulated to recognize their cancer then a vigorous anti-tumor response can be achieved.  Over the last four years, we have developed a method of identifying targets in a patient's cancer that can be seen by their immune system, so called ""neoantigens"".
