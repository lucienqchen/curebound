Studies of ALL tumors have led to improved therapies, and increased long-term survival rates in children from ~58% in the 1970s to over 90% today. Yet 10-20% of ALL patients relapse following their initial treatment, and these patients have a  grim prognosis with survival rates between 21% and 53%. Therefore, there is a need for improved therapies stemming from a better understanding of the molecular events that promote ALL progression and relapse. We hypothesize that some genetic mutations that are important for ALL onset and relapse have remained  undiscovered because they are located in parts of the genome that are difficult to study. Specifically, most studies have focused on mutations that directly affect protein-coding genes, rather than ""non-coding regulatory"" mutations that affect which genes are expressed. We propose to develop new approaches to  identify non-coding mutations in ALL tumors. The basis for our approach is computational analysis of data from new methods (known as ATAC-seq and Hi-C) that provide information about the location and 3D organization of non-coding regulatory sequences in the genome. We will perform ATAC-seq and Hi-C experiments on 20 ALL tumor samples from patients at Rady Children's Hospital-San Diego and use the resulting data to identify non-coding regulatory mutations.

A promising new therapy involves the use of the patient's own white blood cells, known as T cells, being removed and engineered to specifically target tumors before being reintroduced to the patient. While this cancer immunotherapy approach appears to work well for some cancers, it is a laborious and expensive process. An ideal solution is to produce ""off the shelf"" T cells which can be genetically altered to kill tumors. Human pluripotent stem cells can multiply without limit, differentiate into T cells, and be engineered to avoid being rejected by the immune systems of different patients, making them an ideal source universal donor cells. While previous studies have demonstrated derivation of T cells from human pluripotent stem cells, the process is inefficient. In this proposal, we will use genetic screening to individually disrupt genes in stem cells and then derive specific T cells capable of killing tumors. We will select these tumor killing cells and then use DNA sequencing to discern which genes are disrupted in the desired population. These genes can then be studied individually to derive stem cell lines, which will reliably give rise to T cells capable of killing tumors.

According to the CDC, it is the only cancer for which the incidence and mortality are rising. An increasingly significant cause of HCC is fatty liver disease, for which obesity is a risk factor. Since 71% of Americans are overweight or obese, the number of HCCs is expected to rise. Surgery offers the best hope for a cure, yet most HCC patients are not surgical candidates. The best alternative is percutaneous thermal ablation, a minimally invasive way to destroy the tumor without surgery. Yet when cancer cells are left behind, HCC can recur. The likely source of recurrence is from treatment-resistant cells called ""cancer stem cells"" which become stimulated under the stress conditions induced by percutaneous thermal ablation.

Although it is the most common acute leukemia in adults, current treatments, which include chemotherapy and bone marrow transplantation, are largely ineffective, leading to relapse and death in  most patients. AML also occurs in children, and pediatric AML has a much poorer outcome than other childhood leukemias. In light of these issues, AML represents a disease with a significant unmet medical need. Given that  there have been no new therapies for AML in the last 30-40 years, identifying new approaches to target AML is critically important. At a cellular level, AML is heterogeneous and has been shown to be driven by cancer stem cells. Thus strategies aimed at inhibiting cancer stem cell growth and renewal may target the fundamental  propagative abilities of the tumor and allow development of a more targeted therapy. Importantly, AML can often arise from early stage myeloid disorders such as myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) or myeloproliferative  neoplasms (MPN), thus also providing an opportunity to block its progression at earlier stages. Our goal is to develop a new therapeutic agent that can block growth and progression of these myeloid disorders. To this end we have developed antibodies that target a protein required for AML growth. We will test whether these antibodies can block progression of MDS/MPN to AML and improve outcomes.

In the clinic, removal of early diagnosed primary breast cancer, even when the tumor is very small, cannot prevent metastatic recurrence many years later. It remains a big challenge to conduct  metastasis-preventing trials on patients with early stage breast cancer using long term survival and reduction of metastatic load as endpoints, because such studies are lengthy and require a large number of patients,  many of which have good intermediate survival prospects. Consequently, new agents that prevent metastasis from occurring or trigger the regression of already formed metastases are urgent unmet needs. We found that  Ubc13, an enzyme that modifies proteins and controls their ability to transmit signals that stimulate cell proliferation and survival, is important for the metastatic spread of breast cancer. Ubc13 controls metastatic spread through another enzyme called p38. We hypothesize that inhibition of Ubc13 or p38 can be used to prevent BCa metastatic spread and sensitize dormant metastasis initiating cells and existing metastases to chemotherapy. We will investigate in further detail how Ubc13 and p38 control BCa metastasis and define an  Ubc13/p38-dependent metastasis gene signature, which will help in measuring clinical response to Ubc13 or p38.

In the clinic, removal of early diagnosed primary breast cancer, even when the tumor is very small, cannot prevent metastatic recurrence many years later. It remains a big challenge to conduct  metastasis-preventing trials on patients with early stage breast cancer using long term survival and reduction of metastatic load as endpoints, because such studies are lengthy and require a large number of patients,  many of which have good intermediate survival prospects. Consequently, new agents that prevent metastasis from occurring or trigger the regression of already formed metastases are urgent unmet needs. We found that  Ubc13, an enzyme that modifies proteins and controls their ability to transmit signals that stimulate cell proliferation and survival, is important for the metastatic spread of breast cancer. Ubc13 controls metastatic spread through another enzyme called p38. We hypothesize that inhibition of Ubc13 or p38 can be used to prevent BCa metastatic spread and sensitize dormant metastasis initiating cells and existing metastases to chemotherapy. We will investigate in further detail how Ubc13 and p38 control BCa metastasis and define an  Ubc13/p38-dependent metastasis gene signature, which will help in measuring clinical response to Ubc13 or p38. These investigations will provide new insights to the control of BCa metastasis by Ubc13 and p38 and will  provide a rationale for the clinical testing of Ubc13 or p38 inhibitors as anti -metastatic agents in breast cancer.

While the prognosis for patient with early stage EC is quite good, those presenting with advanced stage or recurrent disease have a more guarded  prognosis. Treatment often involves surgery to remove the uterus and other affected organs. Radiation and/or chemotherapy are sometimes required to help improve outcomes. Despite advances in surgical management and therapeutics, the 5-year survival for patients with advanced stage or recurrent disease approaches 50% and represents a significant unmet clinical need. In an effort to improve outcomes, researchers are looking to leverage knowledge of genetic events caused by mutations in the DNA sequence that promote or ""drive"" EC.

Kinases are proteins that can stimulate tumor cell growth and survival, and a large number of new drugs are available that block or inhibit kinase function, resulting in tumor cell death. Identification of individual kinases needed for neuroblastoma cell survival after CRA treatment will lead to new treatment combinations for children with relapsed neuroblastoma using these new kinase inhibitors combined with CRA.

It is therefore imperative to develop new treatments to  improve survival. As we learn more about the factors driving progression of metastatic prostate cancer, we have discovered that the Wnt signaling pathway is activated in these patients. The Wnt pathway possibly confers resistance to standard drug treatments, including hormone therapy and chemotherapy. Prior attempts to target this pathway have been unsuccessful. Cirmtuzumab, a ROR1-binding monoclonal antibody which inhibits the Wnt pathway, is a compelling new drug with the potential to treat CRPC by blocking Wnt activity.  Cirmtuzumab was developed at UCSD by Drs. Kipps, Jamieson, and Carson. Studies are underway in chronic lymphocytic leukemia and breast cancer. We hypothesize that the addition of cirmtuzumab to docetaxel, a chemotherapy drug, will be safe and effective for patients with metastatic CRPC. To test this hypothesis for  the first time, we propose a clinical trial of cirmtuzumab combined with docetaxel in men with prostate cancer. To better understand mechanisms of drug resistance, and which patients might benefit most from  cirmtuzumab, we will perform molecular analyses of cancer tissue and blood samples throughout the study.
